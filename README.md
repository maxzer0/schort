## Installation instructions:

2. Create a user and adjust permissions to write at least into /opt/schort/data
2. Install requirements (see below)
3. Configure your wsgi or fcgi server
4. Configure your webserver that he talks to your wsgi/fcgi server

## Requirements:

| Module        | Explanation   |
| ------------- |---------------|
| Flask         | Flask handels all HTTP-stuff in this application |
| sqlite3       | In gentoo this useflag needs to be set while compiling python3     |

## ÂµWSGI

The schort.wsgi file can be set as UWSGI_PROGRAM if you use uWSGI.
Keep in mind, that the UWSGI_DIR needs to be set to the path where schort.py resists.
This is because schort is not installed in a global scope. Since schort.wsgi imports schort.py it needs his workspace in the same folder.

## Todo (maxzr0)
- [ ] transform into kubernetes
- [ ] proper reverse proxy / https support
